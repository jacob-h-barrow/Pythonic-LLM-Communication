# Pythonic LLM Communications
## 20 Types For Life
### Description
- Learn 20 types in Python that can change the world*. Yes, knowing only 20 types can change your business, projects, or education! Never in history has it been so easy to prototype and develop software solutions without any actual coding. It's not a gimmick, knowing these 20 types can help facilitate directed communications with a large language model. Using static typed prompt-engineering, one can implement and produce code that's mapped to C-suite policies before they step out of the conference room. Let the large language model handle all of your messy technical implementations. By using this reference, we can step away from the nuisances of being programmers, and instead become high-level designers. It's the first time in history that managers can get rid of or quickly redesign software dependencies without digging through the code. Finally, using static typed prompt-engineering, you can provide mission assurance and cyber resiliency in light-speed against zero-day attacks.
*20 types
    - Five primitive types: int, str, float, list, and tuple
    - Two OOP types: class, and dataclass
    - 13 Collections/Collections.ABC types: Hashable, Sized, Callable, Container, Iterable/Iterator, Collection, Sequence/MutableSequence, Set/MutableSet, and Mapping/MutableMapping.
### Why use this resource?
- One principle says it all: asymmetric warfare! Never in history have we had so much software productivity at our finger tips. Through directed static typed prompt-engineering, we can produce an unprecendented cyber response with little human capital. No longer is your organization crippled by Advanced Persistence Threats. Using this reference, you can take your cyber defense to a whole new level!
### Who is this for?
- Pythonistas and cyber professionals with more than a year's worth of Python programming experience. A substitute for this real-life experience could be made up by working through the Magna Carta for Cybersecurity reference.
### What's in this repo?
- All of the supporting code associated with the physical reference.
